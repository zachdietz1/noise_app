</p>


## Description

The following is an IOS app, written in Objective C, produced by Zach Dietz and Jeb King as a CS50 final project. Originally, the app aimed to produce noise cancellation by accessing the microphone, processing the ambient noise, and producing a sound cancelling (inverse) wave. However, this proved to be too difficult in the final project time frame, so what follows is an app with several noise tracks to help drown out ambient noise. Jeb and Zach are still working on the noise cancelling portion of the app.
